## Featured Projects

### Star(duino)Wars RFID Lock with Multi-Factor Authentication
This project is a secure lock system that uses both an RFID card and a password for access. Itâ€™s built with an Arduino Uno, an RFID reader, a keypad, and a servo motor to simulate locking and unlocking a door.

#### Key Features:
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Combines RFID and a 4-digit password.
- **Secure password storage**: Uses SHA-256 hashing.
- **Fun melodies**:
  - ðŸŽµ Success: *Star Wars Main Theme*.
  - ðŸŽµ Failure: *Imperial March*.
- **Logging with Raspberry Pi**: Tracks login attempts.
